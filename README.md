# wine-quality-prediction
Using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, I developed a neural network model to classify wine types (red and white) and predict quality based on chemical properties. Achieved over 93% accuracy, documented process in Jupyter Notebook for transparency and reproducibility.
